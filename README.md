# Arch Linux PKGBUILDs
Various Arch Linux PKGBUILD files that I've created or modified to suit my needs.

These may not necessarily be up to date, and as a consequence, may not work.

## Contents
 - aarch64:
   - chef-client: Arch Linux ARM build based off of https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chef-client using the RHEL aarch64 RPM.
 - x86_64:
   - duplicacy-web: [Duplicacy's](https://duplicacy.com/) (new) web interface. Included is a basic systemd unit file.
   - srt-live-server: basic packaging of the [srt-live-server](https://github.com/Edward-Wu/srt-live-server) project. Example config (from the project) located at `/etc/srt-live-server/sls-example.conf`.
